            <h4>2013–2014: Pre-debut and formation</h4>
            <p>
                In 2013, the six members participated as Team B on the Mnet reality survival show WIN: Who Is Next, competing against other trainees in Team A for the chance to debut as a group. The program involved three rounds of performances and public voting, with Team B eventually losing to Team A, who went on to debut as Winner.[5] During the program, Team B released two singles: "Just Another Boy" and "Climax". The members subsequently appeared as backup dancers in Taeyang's music video for "Ringa Linga".

                In June 2014, Team B appeared in the reality survival program Mix & Match, a follow-up to WIN: Who Is Next to determine the final lineup of the boy group iKon. YG Entertainment CEO Yang Hyun-suk stated that the group's name was derived from the goal to become an "icon for Korea", hence the "K".[5] While Bobby, B.I, and Jinhwan were pre-confirmed members, the remaining members of Team B competed against three new trainees: Jung Jin-hyeong; Yang Hong-seok; and Jung Chan-woo, who had previously appeared on Korean television as a child actor.[7][8] It was reported that 150,000 fans applied to attend the final performance of the show, and before the announcement of iKon's official lineup, YG Entertainment's blog server crashed. Ultimately, Junhoe, Donghyuk and Yunhyeong successfully retained their places in the lineup, with Chan-woo added as the group's final member.
